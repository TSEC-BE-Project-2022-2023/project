[quote]
Finite State Machines are fundamental concepts in Automata Theory and Digital Logic Design.
These FSMs can be converted into a circuit.
In academia, these are called Moore and Mealy machines.
These project aims to introduce an FSM editor in the simulator, generate state transition logic and generate the circuit.
We ideally would like to build upon an exiting open-source FSM editor.
This is an open-ended project and can be extended to demonstrate other concepts like DFA, NFA, PDA and Turing Machines.
