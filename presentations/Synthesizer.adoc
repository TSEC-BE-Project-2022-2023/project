== Introduction
[text-justify]
* Finite Automata are fundamental concepts in Automata Theory and Digital Logic Design.
* These FA can be converted into a circuit.
* Given an FA transition table as input, this project aims to generate the equivalent transition logic with primitive/basic gates/components.


== Literature Review
* CircuitVerse
* JFLAP

=== CircuitVerse

=== Limitations
* Does not support simulation of Automata
* Supports circuit simulation but not conversion from FA

=== JFLAP
image:images/jflap.png[]

=== Limitations
* Has to be run locally with Java
* Users cannot share designed automata easily


== Methodology

=== !
[text-justify%step]
* Determine what states / transitions are needed in order to solve the problem.
* Draw the state diagram, labelling the states and the edges.

* Based on the Activation table of the flip-flops used, construct the truth table from the transition table.
* Based on the truth table, construct the equation for each output variable.

* Reduce the expressions using the suitable algorithm (K-Maps / Quine-McClusky algorithm)
* Convert the expressions to a circuit diagram using logic gates.

== Application
[.text-justify]
Finite Automata can be used to break down a circuit's function into a collection of states and rules which determine when the system moves from one state to another state.
The state diagram consists of nodes which represent the states and arrows (sometimes called edges) which give the possible transitions between states.


== Work done so far
[.stretch]
```console
Enter the minterm expression
Separate the terms with a space( ) or plus(+)
Use ' for inverse
Eg: ab'c + ab'c'
    ab ac'

a + b + ac'

Canonical Expression:
a'bc' + a'bc + ab'c' + ab'c + abc' + abc

KMap:
+----+------+------+------+------+
|  \ | b'c' | b'c  | b c  | b c' |
+----+------+------+------+------+
| a' |      |      |    1 |    1 |
| a  |    1 |    1 |    1 |    1 |
+----+------+------+------+------+
```

[.stretch]
```console
Truth Table:
+-----+---+
| abc |   |
+-----+---+
| 000 | 0 |
| 001 | 0 |
| 010 | 1 |
| 011 | 1 |
| 100 | 1 |
| 101 | 1 |
| 110 | 1 |
| 111 | 1 |
+-----+---+

Minimized expression:
a + b
