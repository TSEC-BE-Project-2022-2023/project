# Digital Circuit to Finite Automata Synthesizer

Finite Automata(FA) is the simplest machine to recognise patterns. The finite automata or finite state machine is an abstract machine that has five elements or tuples. It has a set of states and rules for moving from one state to another but it depends upon the applied input symbol. Basically, it is an abstract model of a digital computer.

In the existing systems, we found out there are not many programs that can convert a given Finite Automata to its equivalent Sequential Digital Circuit and the ones that exist are not that easy to use or portable. Our web-based project helps to tackle these problems and has features such as an easy-to-use interface, and also an inbuilt simulator to demonstrate the working of the automata.
